    <p><h3 class="courgette">“Learning and teaching should not stand on opposite banks and just watch the river flow by; instead, they should embark together on a journey down the water. Through an active, reciprocal exchange, teaching can strengthen learning how to learn.”</h3><span class="motto">— loris malaguzzi</span></p>
    <p>During the post-World War II era in Italy, the desire to bring change while rebuilding a Nation, came along with great economic and social development, including in education.</p>
    <p>Reggio Emilia is a city in Northern Italy, where Loris Malaguzzi, a teacher, worked on a new educational philosophy focused on preschool and primary education. He believed that children were competent, curious and confident individuals, and able to thrive in a self-guided learning environment.</p>
    <p>The Reggio Emilia curriculum is a flexible one that grows from children’s thoughts, ideas and curiosities. It sees expressive arts playing a central role in learning.</p> 
    <p>Importantly, there is a unique reciprocal learning relationship between teacher and child. There is also a very strong emphasis on the child’s social development. The children are taught to understand they are part of a community. They learn how to cultivate their relationships with other children, their family, and teachers.</p>
    <p>To cultivate a lifelong passion for learning and exploration, children are encouraged to be researchers. Many of the projects taken on by the children will be based on their own interests and curiosities, and they can actively participate, explore and question things. Through interactions with peers, educators, parents and the environment, every child grows into an independent and imaginative doer, thinker and learner.</p>
    <p>In this early education approach, a lot of attention is actually given to detailed observation and documentation of learning. But the learning process takes firm priority over the final product.</p>
    <p>Reggio Emilia classrooms are designed to look and feel like home. There are no set lesson plans and the schools emphasise the importance of parents taking an active role in their child’s education.</p>
    <p>One of the fundamental principles under the child-centric Reggio approach is also an emphasis of the environment as the ‘Third Teacher’. Here, the environment is seen as a living space where children are able to explore their learning through social interactions and experimentation.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the Reggio goal is to cultivate a lifelong passion for learning and exploration.</p>

    Providentia’s family of students ranges from 6 months to 16 years old. In order to cater to such a diverse and large group of students, our educators employ the most proven systems for teaching, including the Reggio Emilia approach for our younger students in Australia.
    <p>Our global reach allows our educators to constantly share experiences and approaches on how to deal with issues.</p>
    <p>Providentia’s teaching staff focus on conceptual understanding and ensure pupils take pride in the quality of their work.</p>
    <p>At the early education age, we deliver an innovative and inspiring early childhood education based on the Reggio Emilia approach, a pedagogy that is focused on student-centered and constructivist development that utilises self-directed, experiential learning in relationship-drive environments.</p>
    <p>At the primary and secondary age, we ensure pupils are given a level playing field to excel in all areas of life, whether it be academic or extra-curricular.</p>
    <p>Our portfolio school has developed the Quo Vadis (QV) Baccalaureate that represents a broad curriculum focused on 7 areas of learning: Languages, Sciences (including computer science), Humanities, Creative and Performing Arts, Sports and QV Qualities.</p>
